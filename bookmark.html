        <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an “Arc-de-Triomphe” like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I.ndia Gate is an architectural marvel that took nearly 10 years to build. This war memorial was inaugurated in February 1931. It was built in memory of more than 70,000 soldiers who fought bravely during World War I and lost their lives in the event. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, India Gate boasts an architectural style very similar to Arc de Triomphe, which stands tall in Paris.

            Many years after the construction of India Gate, a small memorial referred to as Amar Jawan Jyoti was constructed under it in 1972, but it was later merged with the Eternal Flame at the National War Memorial.</p>

     <p>The India Gate stands almost 138 feet tall and 30 feet wide on all sides, with a large dome in the center and a flat top. It is made of red Bharatpur stone, and the arch stands on a wide base. On the top of the gate is a large shallow bowl intended to be filled with burning oil, though this rarely is done.</p>

    <p>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>
